## about me
I am a fashion and music guru who has been fortunate enough to grow up surrounded by technology.  Apple WWDC events are what sparked my interest in computers, and
in coding and it has been one crazy journey since the inception of the idea that I could one day contribute to society in a way like that through
my work with other companies.  Maybe even Apple one day.
